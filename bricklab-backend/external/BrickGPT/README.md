## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct:** BrickGPT is fine-tuned from meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, a gated
  model. [Request access to the model](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct), then generate
  a [Hugging Face user access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) and set it as an environment
  variable: `export HF_TOKEN=<your_token>`. The model will be automatically downloaded upon running the code.
- **Gurobi (optional but recommended):** Running stability analysis requires
  a [Gurobi license](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/) to use Gurobi. Academics may request a free license from the
  [Gurobi website](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/); after obtaining the license,
  place it in your *home directory* or
  another [recommended location](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013417211-Where-do-I-place-the-Gurobi-license-file-gurobi-lic).
    - If you do not have access to Gurobi, you can run the code with the option `--use_gurobi False` to use a simpler
      but less accurate connectivity-based method instead of physics-based stability analysis.

### Installing as a standalone project

This repo uses the Python project manager [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). To install this repo as a standalone
project, first install all prerequisites. Then,

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/AvaLovelace1/BrickGPT.git && cd BrickGPT`.
2. *(Optional, required for running the `infer` script and texturing)* Follow these instructions to install ImportLDraw,
   required for rendering brick structure visualizations:
    - Install the ImportLDraw submodule with `git submodule update --init`.
    - Download
      this [background exr file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yux0sEqWVpXGMT9Z5J094ISfvxhH-_5K/view?usp=share_link)
      and place it in the `ImportLDraw/loadldraw` subdirectory.
    - Download the [LDraw parts library](https://library.ldraw.org/library/updates/complete.zip) and
      extract it in your *home directory*:
      `(cd ~ && wget https://library.ldraw.org/library/updates/complete.zip && unzip complete.zip)`.
        - If you wish to put the LDraw parts library in a different directory, set the environment variable
          `LDRAW_LIBRARY_PATH` to the path of the `ldraw` directory: `export LDRAW_LIBRARY_PATH=path/to/ldraw`.
3. Finally, [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), and run `uv sync` to create a Python
   virtual environment with all dependencies installed. Python dependencies are defined in `pyproject.toml`.

### Installing as a package

To install this repo as a package in your own Python project, first install all prerequisites. Then, run

```zsh
uv add "https://github.com/AvaLovelace1/BrickGPT.git"
```

if using uv, or

```zsh
pip install "https://github.com/AvaLovelace1/BrickGPT.git"
```

if using pip.

## Running inference interactively

### Gradio demo

**[A Gradio demo is available here.](https://avalovelace1.github.io/BrickGPT/demo/)** Its source code is provided in the subdirectory [src/demo](src/demo).

### Command line interface (CLI)

You can run BrickGPT inference through the command line with the following command:

```zsh
uv run infer
```

This script starts an interactive session where you can input a prompt and get a response from the model.
The [model weights](https://huggingface.co/AvaLovelace/BrickGPT) will automatically be downloaded from Hugging Face.

If you wish to run inference with a different set of model weights, specify them using the `--model_name_or_path`
option. See `uv run infer -h` for a full list of options.

#### Example interaction

Here is an example interaction using the `infer` script:

```text
> uv run infer
Enter a prompt, or <Return> to exit: Table featuring a flat rectangular surface over four evenly spaced legs.
Enter a filename to save the output image (default=output.png): output.png
Enter a generation seed (default=42): 42

Academic license - for non-commercial use only - expires 2026-02-19
--------------------
Finished generating in 63.53s.
Total # bricks: 59
Total # brick rejections: 98
Brick rejection reasons: {'collision': 5, 'already_rejected': 93}
Total # regenerations: 4
Saved results to /home/apun/BrickGPT/output.txt, /home/apun/BrickGPT/output.ldr, and /home/apun/BrickGPT/output.png
--------------------
Enter another prompt, or <Return> to exit:
```

Three output files are created: `output.png`, `output.txt`, and `output.ldr`.

`output.png` contains a rendered image of the generated brick structure:

<img src="assets/output_img.png" alt="Rendered brick structure output image" width="256"/>

`output.txt` contains the brick structure in brick-by-brick text format, where each line of the form `hxw (x,y,z)`
represents a brick of height `h` and width `w` at position `(x,y,z)`:

```text
1x2 (16,18,0)
1x2 (16,13,0)
2x2 (0,18,0)
2x2 (0,13,0)
1x2 (16,18,1)
[...]
```

And finally, `output.ldr` contains the brick structure in LDraw format, which can be opened with any LDraw-compatible
software.

## Running texturing

The subdirectory `src/texture` contains the code for generating the UV texture or per-brick color given a brick design.
To run texturing, `cd` into [src/texture](src/texture) and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file there.

## Running mesh-to-brick

The subdirectory `src/mesh2brick` contains the code for converting a 3D object mesh into a brick structure.
To run mesh-to-brick, `cd` into [src/mesh2brick](src/mesh2brick) and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file
there.

## Running fine-tuning

BrickGPT was created by
fine-tuning [Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct)
on the custom brick structure dataset [StableText2Brick](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AvaLovelace/StableText2Brick),
converted
into instructional format. We used Hugging Face [TRL](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index)
with [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index) for fine-tuning.

To replicate the fine-tuning process, first install additional Python dependencies with `uv sync --extra finetuning`.
Then, follow these instructions:

1. Prepare the brick structure dataset for fine-tuning with
   `uv run prepare_finetuning_dataset --input_path AvaLovelace/StableText2Brick --output_path [FINETUNING_DATASET_PATH]`.
   This converts the dataset into the instructional format required for fine-tuning LLaMA.
    - If you wish to run fine-tuning with your own brick structure dataset, replace `AvaLovelace/StableText2Brick` with
      the path to
      your dataset. This dataset should have the fields "captions" and "bricks". The "bricks" field should contain a
      brick
      structure in the text format described in the paper, and the "captions" field should contain a list of one or more
      descriptions of the brick structure.
2. Download the pretrained [Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct) to
   some directory `[PRETRAINED_DIR]`.
   **IMPORTANT:** Replace the `config.json`, `special_tokens_map.json`, and `tokenizer_config.json` files with the ones
   in the `finetuning_config_files` directory. This specifies the `pad_token` to be different from the `eos_token`,
   fixing a fine-tuning [issue](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/issues/416) where the model will not learn to
   output EOS tokens properly.
3. Initialize the Accelerate config file with `uv run accelerate config`.
4. Run fine-tuning with
   `uv run ./scripts/finetune.zsh [PRETRAINED_DIR] [OUTPUT_DIR] [RUN_NAME] [FINETUNING_DATASET_PATH]`. The
   fine-tuned model will be saved to `[OUTPUT_DIR]/[RUN_NAME]`.
